## Garden of the Sleeping Giant

Located at the foothills of the Nausori Highlands, the Garden of the Sleeping Giant is home to a vast collection of orchids and tropical plants. It's a great place for a relaxing walk.

The garden was originally the private collection of the late actor Raymond Burr, best known for his roles in the TV shows Perry Mason and Ironside. Today, it houses one of the largest collections of orchids in Fiji, with over 2000 different varieties.

In addition to the orchids, the garden also features lily ponds, serene lawns, and a dense jungle-like forest. A canopy-covered boardwalk winds its way through the landscape, allowing visitors to take in the beauty of the garden at their own pace.

The garden is a perfect spot for picnics, bird watching, and photography. It's a must-visit for nature lovers and plant enthusiasts.
