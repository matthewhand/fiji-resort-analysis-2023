Upload the images to the GitHub repository and replace the placeholder images in the markdown files with the URLs of the uploaded images.
2. **Include 3 reviews for each lodging and attraction gathered from the internet, featuring positive, neutral, and negative sentiments**: Find reviews for each resort and attraction on travel websites. Include one positive, one neutral, and one negative review for each resort and attraction in the corresponding markdown files.
3. **Develop an interactive data visualization tool presenting various resort capacities in Fiji or similar tourist islands near Australia over the past year**: Obtain data on resort capacities from the resorts' official websites or from travel websites. Use this data to create interactive data visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Add the code for the data visualizations to the notebook.
4. **Ensure the travel brochure content has been created, the data visualization tool has been developed, and the GitHub repo has been updated as per the instructions provided**: Complete all the other tasks. Once all the other tasks are completed, the travel brochure content will be created, the data visualization tool will be developed, and the GitHub repo will be updated.
5. **Write at least 500 words for each of the research files: research-lodging, research-flights, and so on**: Research each resort and attraction and write about them. Include information about the resort or attraction, its features, its location, and any other relevant information in the corresponding markdown files.
6. **Upload them to the GitHub repo, including a detailed itinerary section, as well as diagrams, tables, and other visual aids for clarity**: Create a detailed itinerary section for the travel brochure. Include a day-by-day plan of activities for a trip to Fiji in the itinerary. Add the itinerary to the travel brochure markdown file. Also, add diagrams, tables, and other visual aids to the markdown files for clarity.
7. **While developing the itinerary, consider offering alternative options, such as different routes or activities, to cater to various user preferences and interests**: Consider different types of travelers when developing the itinerary. Offer alternative options for each day of the itinerary to cater to different preferences.
