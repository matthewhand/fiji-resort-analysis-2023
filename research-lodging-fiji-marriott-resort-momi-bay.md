## Description

The Tavoro Waterfalls, located within the Bouma National Heritage Park on Taveuni Island, are a 'must-see' for any visitor to Fiji. There are three separate falls, each with its own swimming hole, and a well-maintained trail leading up to them. The first waterfall is an easy walk from the visitor center, while the second and third require a bit more effort but are well worth it.
