## Description

Sigatoka Sand Dunes National Park is Fiji's first National Park and has significant archaeological and ecological importance. The dunes range from 20 to 60 meters high and offer stunning views of the surrounding area. The park covers an area of 650 hectares and includes a unique dune system that varies between 1 to 2 kilometers wide and stretches along 5 kilometers of coastline. The dunes were formed over millions of years and are a natural habitat for a variety of bird species. The park also has an archaeological significance with pottery shards dating back 2600 years and one of the largest burial sites in the Pacific from Lapita people (ancestors of the Polynesians) found here. Visitors can enjoy a guided tour of the park, bird watching, and stunning views of the Coral Coast from the top of the dunes.
