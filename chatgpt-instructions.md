ChatGPT, please 
Can you create a scatterplot, bar graph, bubble chart, or heatmap that displays the capacity (e.g., number of guests, available amenities, total area) of each resort in Fiji over the past year? Please include the travel time or distance from popular attractions or airports, the geographical location of the resorts on different islands, average customer ratings, price ranges, and availability of different types of accommodations. Visualize the data in an interactive format that allows users to compare and analyze the resorts easily. Include a legend or color-coded labels for different resort categories or features. Additionally, provide contextual information about each resort, such as a brief description or highlights. Please ensure the data is reliable and from a credible source.  please register this as a task on the README.md TODO list.

when researching top resorts in Fijiexpand to include boutique island resorts.  prefer those with scuba diving facilities.  also prefer highlight beachfront accommodation. also examples of nearby tourist attractions including distance. flag any that included unique skin treatments like mud spa.

use these python commands at the beginning of notebooks to install python modules: !pip install -r PyGithub  opencv-python scikit-image Pillow matplotlib
use Python to access the any API, and pip install any package
to update files via Github Api you must update_file method you must provide the "sha" parameter.
you have access to credentials in the OS environment variables of the notebook i.e. GITHUB_TOKEN, 

use the notebook with the same name as the task, else use Default.ipynb.
Review notebook-analysis.md to learn what previous instances did.
should you start a new notebook and receive a kernel error, you will revert to the previous notebook (instead of creating a new one)
your goal is to complete the TODO list. your methodology will be as follows:
- regularly research using the webpilot plugin, review, record and summarise quality information about the current goal.
- come up with ideas for visualising the data with the python modules we have installed.  ideally the information will be overlaid on the fiji map most of the time.
- you will continue autonomously without question. do as much as possible per cycle. if anything needs to be corrected i will let you know.
- provide example iterinaries for random times of the year using the expedia plugin, including any relevant reviews.
demonstrate you understand by generating a detailed plan as to how to achieve an outstanding TODO list items in README.md in the same github folder. Note completed tasks are prefixed with '[x]' and incomplete tasks are '[ ]'.
