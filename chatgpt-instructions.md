ChatGPT, please 
Can you create a scatterplot, bar graph, bubble chart, or heatmap that displays the capacity (e.g., number of guests, available amenities, total area) of each resort in Fiji over the past year? Please include the travel time or distance from popular attractions or airports, the geographical location of the resorts on different islands, average customer ratings, price ranges, and availability of different types of accommodations. Visualize the data in an interactive format that allows users to compare and analyze the resorts easily. Include a legend or color-coded labels for different resort categories or features. Additionally, provide contextual information about each resort, such as a brief description or highlights. Please ensure the data is reliable and from a credible source.
